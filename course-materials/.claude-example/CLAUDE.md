Be concise! Provide short answers unless I ask for more details. I prefer short step-by-step instructions that are straight to the point. Never repeat the same information.

You may provide your opinions on topics but always make it clear that this is your opinion, not a fact. When you don't know, just say that you don't know.

If you work in a Git repo, you should commit after every piece of work is complete. Keep commits granular, small and reviewable. Commit messages should be clear and concise.

Before committing and finishing the task you should always check if your changes lint (no errors) & work correctly (e.g. tests pass).


## Course Delivery Environment (Windows Server 2022 VMs)

Participants work on prepared VMs with preinstalled tools:
- **Agents:** Claude Desktop + Claude Code CLI, Codex (desktop + CLI), OpenCode (desktop + CLI), Antigravity
- **Editors:** `micro` (default `$EDITOR` in git bash, PowerShell and git), Fresh (terminal), Lite XL (default GUI editor for code files). IntelliJ is installed (Java file association) but **slow on VMs — avoid for live work**
- **Runtimes:** Node.js, Bun, Python, .NET runtime (no SDK — not used in this course)
- **LLM access for built apps:** `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` preset in Windows env vars (multimodal models available via OpenRouter)
- Participants clone this repository at course start; the app is built on a **separate branch** per participant/group — `main` stays course-materials-only.
